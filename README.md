## Welcome to Math 32B Notes

This is meant to be a place to share my personal notes for Math 32B (a multivariable integral calculus class at UCLA) online.

### Intro

* In calculus, we study functions on _geometric spaces_, where a geometric space can be any line, plane, curve, surface, coordinate space, etc.
* Functions assign a number or vector to every point of our space.
  * A function that assigns numbers is called a _scalar field_, while one that assigns vectors is called a _vector field_.
  * For instance, a temperature map would be a _scalar field_ since we are assigning a scalar value to every point on Earth, while a wind map would be a _vector field_ since we are assign a vector containing wind speed and direction.
* The **integral** of a function lets us find areas under curves, by summing up infinitesmal slices of area under that curve.
* We can do that using Riemann Sums:
  * First, partition the invertal

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/iangalvez/math-32b/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
